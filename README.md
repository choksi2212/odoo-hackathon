## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a modern full-stack web application built using the *MERN stack* (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with *TypeScript* on the frontend and *Tailwind CSS* for fast, responsive UI styling. It serves as a *boilerplate or starter template* for creating secure, scalable, and production-ready web applications that are both backend-rich and frontend-dynamic.

The application follows *industry-standard best practices* in terms of project architecture, folder structure, and coding patterns. It supports *user authentication, **RESTful APIs, and a **component-driven frontend UI*. This app is designed to be extended easily for a wide variety of use-cases — from dashboards and admin panels to SaaS platforms and personal projects.

## 🧩 Key Functionalities

### ✅ Backend (Express.js)

- 🔐 *User Authentication:* Supports secure login & signup using JWT tokens
- 🧾 *API Routing:* Modular Express routing using a controller-service pattern
- 💾 *MongoDB Integration:* Uses Mongoose for schema modeling, validations, and queries
- 🛡 *Middleware Stack:* Custom error handling, route protection, and request logging
- 🧪 *Testing:* Comes with Jest + Supertest for unit and API tests
- 🔧 *Environment Configuration:* All sensitive config handled with dotenv
- 📁 *Code Structure:* Follows a clean MVC-style architecture with reusable utilities

### ✅ Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)

- 🧭 *Routing:* Page navigation handled with React Router
- 🎨 *Tailwind CSS:* Utility-first, responsive design system
- 🧱 *Component-Based UI:* Modular components in components/ directory
- ⚡ *Vite Build Tool:* Ultra-fast dev server and optimized production builds
- 🛠 *Linting and Type Safety:* ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript for quality control
- 🔌 *API Integration:* Fetches backend data via Axios or Fetch with VITE_API_URL support

## 🧠 System Design Philosophy

| Layer     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend   | Handles authentication, data persistence, business logic, and API endpoints |
| Frontend  | Presents a user-friendly UI, fetches data via APIs, and handles client logic |
| Database  | MongoDB used for document storage with flexible schema                      |
| Security  | JWT-based auth, validation middleware, environment separation               |

## 🔗 How Backend and Frontend Interact

1. User logs in via the frontend UI.
2. The frontend sends credentials to the backend API (/api/auth/login).
3. Backend verifies and returns a *JWT token*.
4. Frontend stores the token in localStorage or cookies.
5. All protected API requests from the frontend include the token in the Authorization header.
6. Backend verifies the token via middleware and allows access to secure routes (e.g., /api/users).
